## Development Challenge

**Hey there!**

Thank you for your interest in joining our team, and offering to spend some of your personal time allowing us to evaluate your technical skills. As part of our selection process, we've prepared a development challenge that assesses a range of skills important to us. This project is intentionally designed with certain imperfections to test a broad range of skills required in real-world scenarios.

### Project Overview

You're tasked with improving a **User Profile Management System**. The application is divided into two main parts:

1. **User Profile Management**: A section for managing user profiles with basic CRUD operations.
2. **Data Table**: A component designed to display and process a large set of data, intentionally built with inefficiencies for you to diagnose and optimize.

### Starting Steps

Begin by spending approximately 15 minutes reviewing the project to identify general issues you might encounter, such as "Suboptimal state management leading to unnecessary re-renders" or "Hardcoded values that could be dynamically set or stored as constants". Please note these are just illustrative examples and not necessarily specific to this project. Documenting these observations will help us understand your ability to analyze and strategize improvements, even if time constraints prevent you from addressing all of them.

Note: Feel free to use any external libraries, frameworks, or code snippets that you prefer for any parts of this project. If you do use any of these, please mention that you have used them, where you have used them, and where you sourced them from.

### Primary Tasks

- **Bug Identification and Fixes**: The application includes intentional bugs and inefficiencies. Your task is to identify and rectify them.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Assess and enhance the application's performance, particularly in areas that significantly impact user experience.
- **Identifying Other Issues**: Beyond the explicit tasks, we're interested in your ability to spot and document potential improvements or issues within the project, from architecture and scalability to code readability and maintainability.

### Optional Enhancements

If you feel inspired, consider enhancing the application further. This could involve making the UI more elegant or introducing features that you believe would add value. Here are a few areas you might explore:

- **UI Elegance**: Update the interface to improve aesthetics and user experience. Creativity and the use of modern UI practices are encouraged.
- **New Features/Enhancements**: Consider adding new features, which are not required but could showcase your capability to extend the application's functionality.

### Notes on the Project

- The project is set up with intentional flaws, ranging from missing files and bugs to architectural, scalability, and performance issues.
- You will be expected to identify and fix any significant performance issues you encounter.
- The application is segmented into two sections: user profiles and a data table. Each has its unique set of challenges and opportunities for improvements across a wide variety of dimensions.

### Deliverables

Please provide the source code for the completed project, including setup instructions as necessary. Document any significant changes you make, especially those addressing the issues you identified initially. If you choose to implement optional enhancements, briefly describe what you added and your rationale.

We appreciate your effort and time in undertaking this challenge and look forward to seeing your approach to improving this application.

Best of luck!
